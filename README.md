**Guessing Number Game**  

The *Guessing Number Game* is a simple yet captivating program designed using **C programming** by **Nikhil Singh**. It is a perfect blend of logic and fun, offering an interactive way to challenge your guessing skills while exploring the basics of programming.  

### **Game Concept**  
In this game, the computer randomly generates a number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100), and the player's goal is to guess it. With each guess, the program provides helpful hints, making it an engaging and rewarding experience for the player.  

### **Key Features**  
1. **Random Number Generation**:  
   The program uses C's `rand()` function to create a random number, ensuring unpredictability and a unique challenge each time.  

2. **User Interaction**:  
   The player inputs their guesses, and the program responds with:  
   - **"Too High"** if the guess exceeds the target number.  
   - **"Too Low"** if the guess is below the target number.  

3. **Dynamic Feedback Loop**:  
   The game continues until the player guesses the correct number, making it highly engaging.  

4. **Customizable Range**:  
   The range of numbers can be adjusted, allowing players to set their own difficulty level.  

5. **Programming Learning Opportunity**:  
   This program demonstrates fundamental C programming concepts, including:  
   - Random number generation (`rand()` and `srand()`),  
   - Loops (`while` or `do-while`),  
   - Conditional statements (`if-else`),  
   - Input/Output functions (`scanf`, `printf`).  

### **Why Play?**  
This game not only provides endless fun but also serves as a great learning tool for budding programmers. By analyzing and modifying the code, players can deepen their understanding of C programming fundamentals.  

Get ready to dive into this exciting guessing adventure crafted by **Nikhil Singh** and experience the power of C programming in action! ðŸŽ®ðŸ“š
